3d model shape retrieval

source code is the same as code from code.google.com/p/3dmsr which is put on google project hosting by myself last year.

It focus on feature extraction on 3d model shape. The core algorithm from D.Vranic's phd paper, i.e depth buffer descriptor.

it includes four small projects: 1. depthmapdll: the core part, i.e depth buffer descriptor. 2. eufc : base library code 3. europeCS3DMR: a simple application with depthmapdll library 4. vtkoffdll : it is a independent part, extended VTK library(open source)
